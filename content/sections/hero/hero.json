In this game, players will be able to defeat enemies, conquer dungeons, collect unique avatars, trade them on the marketplace, and explore the stories behind each character. Players will have true ownership and control of in-game assets such as mechs, equipment, avatars, and game currency by having these assets exist as fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on an energy-efficient and scalable blockchain.",
